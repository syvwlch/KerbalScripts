# KerbalScripts
Experiments in scripting for Kerbal Space Program, currently using KRPC &amp; Python.

Also using this as an opportunity to learn some software development discipline using git, unit tests, logging, and, eventually, test driven development.

Only dependency at the moment is KRPC: `pip install krpc`
