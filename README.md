# KerbalScripts
Experiments in scripting for Kerbal Space Program, currently using KRPC &amp; Python.

Also using this as an opportunity to learn some software development discipline using git, unit tests, logging, and, eventually, test driven development.

Check the pipfile for dependencies, but the only dependency at the moment is KRPC: `pip install krpc`
